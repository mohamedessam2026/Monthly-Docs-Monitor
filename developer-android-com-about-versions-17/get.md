You can get Android 17 in any of the following ways:

* [Get Android 17 on a Google Pixel device](#on_pixel)
* [Set up the Android Emulator](#on_emulator)
* [Get a generic system image (GSI)](#on_gsi)

## Get Android 17 Beta on a Google Pixel device

To get Android 17 on a supported Google Pixel device, [enroll your device in the
Android Beta for Pixel program](https://g.co/androidbeta).

Enrolling is a simple and fast process, and it's highly recommended for early
adopters and developers. In most cases, you don't need to do a full reset of
your data to move to the Android 17 Beta, but it's recommended that you back up
data before enrolling your device.

Once enrolled, your device will receive regular over-the-air (OTA) updates for
the duration of the platform's release cycle—including Quarterly Platform
Releases (QPRs)—unless you opt out earlier.

During the Android Beta for Pixel program's release cycle, there are four stable
releases to the public (the official platform release followed by three
Quarterly Platform Releases). When you apply a stable release update, you can
opt out of future Beta updates **without a data wipe** for a limited time (until
you apply the next Beta update, if you choose to do so).

### Supported Google Pixel devices

Android 17 OTAs and downloads are available for the following Pixel devices:

* Pixel 6
* Pixel 6 Pro
* Pixel 6a
* Pixel 7
* Pixel 7 Pro
* Pixel 7a
* Pixel Tablet
* Pixel Fold
* Pixel 8
* Pixel 8 Pro
* Pixel 8a
* Pixel 9
* Pixel 9 Pro
* Pixel 9 Pro XL
* Pixel 9 Pro Fold
* Pixel 9a
* Pixel 10

* Pixel 10 Pro XL
* Pixel 10 Pro Fold

### Flash or manually install a system image

Alternatively, if you'd rather flash your device, we recommend using the
[Android Flash
Tool](https://flash.android.com/preview/cinnamonbun-beta3).
If you need to flash your device manually for some other reason, you can get an
Android 17 system image for your device on the [Pixel downloads page](/about/versions/17/download). See
the general instructions on the downloads page for how to flash a system image
to your device. This approach can be useful when you need more control over
testing, such as for automated testing or regression testing.
Android 17 Beta images are available for [supported Pixel devices](#google-pixel-devices).
**Note:** After you've flashed a Beta build to a supported
Pixel device, you're automatically enrolled in over-the-air updates of all
subsequent Beta builds through the final release.

## Set up the Android Emulator

Configuring the Android Emulator to run Android 17 is a flexible solution for
exploring new features and APIs and testing Android 17 behavior changes. It
lets you emulate various screen sizes and device characteristics.

Depending on the type of testing you need to do, consider setting up a variety
of virtual devices from these device categories:

* [Phone](#phone-avd)
* [Tablet or large-screen device](#large-screen-avd)

### Set up a virtual device (phone)

To set up a virtual device to emulate a typical phone, follow these steps:

1. Install [Android Studio Meerkat | 2024.3.1](/studio).
2. In Android Studio, click **Tools > SDK Manager**.
3. In the **SDK Tools tab**, select the latest version of **Android Emulator**,
   and then click the **OK** button. This action installs the latest version
   if it isn't already installed.
4. In Android Studio, click **Tools > Device Manager**. In the
   **Device Manager** panel, click the
   **Add a new device** button ![Add new device
   icon](/static/studio/images/buttons/ic_plus_dark.png),
   then select **Create Virtual Device**.

   ![Create an Android Virtual Device in Android
   Studio](/static/about/versions/17/images/17-create-avd.png)
5. From the **Phone Category tab**, select a device definition for a
   [supported Pixel device](#on_pixel), then click the **Next** button.
6. Find the Android 17 system image, named **Baklava**, and click the
   **Download** button ![Download
   icon](/static/about/versions/17/images/17-studio-download.png)
   next to the **Release Name**. After the download completes, select
   this system image, and then click the **Next** button.
7. Finalize other settings for your virtual device, and then click the
   **Finish** button.
8. After returning to the list of virtual devices in the **Device Manager**,
   find your Android 17 virtual device, and then click the **Start** button
   ![Start button icon](/static/about/versions/17/images/17-launch-avd-icon.png).

### Set up a virtual device (tablet or large-screen)

To set up a virtual device to emulate a tablet or other large-screen device,
follow these steps:

1. Install [Android Studio Meerkat | 2024.3.1](/studio).
2. In Android Studio, click **Tools > SDK Manager**.
3. In the **SDK Tools tab**, select the latest version of **Android Emulator**,
   and then click the **OK** button. This action installs the latest version
   if it isn't already installed.
4. In Android Studio, click **Tools > Device Manager**. In the **Device
   Manager** panel, click the **Add a new device** button ![Add new device
   icon](/static/studio/images/buttons/ic_plus_dark.png),
   then select **Create Virtual Device**.

   ![Create an Android Virtual Device in Android
   Studio](/static/about/versions/17/images/17-create-avd.png)
5. From the **Tablet Category tab**, select a device definition with a large
   screen, such as the **Pixel Tablet**, or from the **Phone Category tab**,
   select the **Pixel Fold**. Then, click the **Next** button.
6. Find the Android 17 system image, named **Baklava**, and click the
   **Download** button ![Download
   icon](/static/about/versions/17/images/17-studio-download.png)
   next to the **Release Name**. After the download completes, select
   this system image, and then click the **Next** button.
7. Finalize other settings for your virtual device, and then click the
   **Finish** button.
8. After returning to the list of virtual devices in the **Device Manager**,
   find your Android 17 virtual device, and then click the **Start** button
   ![Start button
   icon](/static/about/versions/17/images/17-launch-avd-icon.png).

Repeat these steps to create large screen device definitions that you can use to
test your app in a variety of large screen scenarios.

#### Resizable emulator

In addition to large screen virtual devices that you can configure for Android
17, you can try the resizable device configuration. When you're using a
resizable device definition with an Android 17 system image, the Android
Emulator lets you toggle between the three reference devices: phone,
foldable, and tablet. When using the foldable reference device, you can also
toggle between folded and unfolded states.

This flexibility makes it easier to both validate your layout at design time and
test the behavior at runtime, using the same reference devices. To create a new
resizable emulator, use the Device Manager in Android Studio to create a new
virtual device and select the **Resizable** device definition in the **Phone**
category.

Use the resizable device definition for the Android Emulator
to test Android 17 in a variety of large screen scenarios.

## Get a generic system image (GSI)

Android [Generic System Image (GSI)](/topic/generic-system-image) binaries are available to developers
for app testing and validation purposes on supported Treble-compliant devices.
You can use these images to address any compatibility issues as well as discover
and report OS and framework issues.

See the [GSI documentation](/topic/generic-system-image) for device requirements, flashing instructions,
and information on choosing the right image type for your device. Once you're
ready to download a GSI binary, see the [Downloads section](/topic/generic-system-image/releases#android-gsi-17) on the GSI
binaries page.
