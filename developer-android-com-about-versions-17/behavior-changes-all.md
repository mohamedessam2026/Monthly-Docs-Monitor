# Behavior changes: all apps Stay organized with collections Save and categorize content based on your preferences.





The Android 17 platform includes behavior changes that might affect your app.
The following behavior changes apply to *all apps* when they run on Android 17,
regardless of [`targetSdkVersion`](/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#target). You should test your app and then modify
it as needed to support these changes, where applicable.

Make sure to also review the list of [behavior changes that only affect apps
targeting Android 17](/about/versions/17/behavior-changes-17).

**Note:** This page lists some of the more important changes. For more detailed
information, see the [Android 17 release notes](/about/versions/17/release-notes).

## Security

Android 17 includes the following improvements to device and app
security.

### usesClearTraffic deprecation plan

In a future release, we plan to deprecate the `usesCleartextTraffic` element.
Apps that need to make unencrypted (HTTP) connections should migrate to
using a [network security configuration](/privacy-and-security/security-config) file, which lets you
specify which domains your app needs to make cleartext connections to.

Be aware that network security configuration files are only supported on API
levels 24 and higher. If your app has a minimum API level lower than 24, you
should do *both* of the following:

* Set the `usesCleartextTraffic` attribute to `true`
* Use a network configuration file

If your app's minimum API level is 24 or higher, you can use a network
configuration file and you don't need to set `usesCleartextTraffic`.

### Restrict implicit URI grants

Currently, if an app launches an intent with a URI that has the action `Send`,
`SendMultiple`, or `ImageCapture`, the system automatically grants the read and
write URI permissions to the target app. We plan to change this behavior in
Android 18. For this reason, we recommend that apps explicitly
grant the relevant URI permissions instead of relying on the system to grant
them.

### Per-app keystore limits

Apps should avoid creating excessive numbers of keys in Android Keystore,
because it is a shared resource for all apps on the device. Beginning with
Android 17, the system enforces a limit on the number of keys an app can
own. The limit is 50,000 keys for non-system apps targeting
Android 17 (API level 37) or higher, and 200,000 keys for all other apps.
System apps have a limit of 200,000 keys, regardless of which API level they
target.

If an app attempts to create keys beyond the limit, the creation fails with a
[`KeyStoreException`](/reference/java/security/KeyStoreException). The exception's message string contains information
about the key limit. If the app calls [`getNumericErrorCode()`](/reference/android/security/KeyStoreException#getNumericErrorCode()) on the
exception, the return value depends on what API level the app targets:

* Apps targeting Android 17 (API level 37) or higher:
  `getNumericErrorCode()` returns the new `ERROR_TOO_MANY_KEYS` value.
* All other apps: `getNumericErrorCode()` returns `ERROR_INCORRECT_USAGE`.

## User experience and system UI

Android 17 includes the following changes that are intended
to create a more consistent, intuitive user experience.

### Restoring default IME visibility after rotation

Beginning with Android 17, when the device's configuration changes (for
example, through rotation), and this is not handled by the app itself, the
previous IME visibility is not restored.

If your app undergoes a configuration change that it does not handle, and the
app needs the keyboard to be visible after the change,
you must explicitly request this. You can make this request in one of the
following ways:

* Set the `android:windowSoftInputMode` attribute to `stateAlwaysVisible`.
* Programmatically request the soft keyboard in your activity's `onCreate()`
  method, or add the `onConfigurationChanged()` method.

## Human input

Android 17 includes the following changes that affect how
apps interact with human input devices like keyboards and touchpads.

### Touchpads deliver relative events by default during pointer capture

Beginning with Android 17, if an app requests pointer capture using
[`View.requestPointerCapture()`](/reference/android/view/View#requestPointerCapture()) and the user uses a touchpad, the system
recognizes pointer movement and scrolling gestures from the user's touches and
reports them to the app in the same way as pointer and scroll wheel movements
from a captured mouse. In most cases, this removes the need for apps that
support captured mice to add special handling logic for touchpads. For more
details, see the documentation for [`View.POINTER_CAPTURE_MODE_RELATIVE`](/reference/android/view/View#POINTER_CAPTURE_MODE_RELATIVE).

Previously, the system did not attempt to recognize gestures from the touchpad,
and instead delivered the raw, absolute finger locations to the app in a similar
format to touchscreen touches. If an app still requires this absolute data, it
should call the new [`View.requestPointerCapture(int)`](/reference/android/view/View#requestPointerCapture(int)) method with
[`View.POINTER_CAPTURE_MODE_ABSOLUTE`](/reference/android/view/View#POINTER_CAPTURE_MODE_ABSOLUTE) instead.

## Media

Android 17 includes the following changes to media behavior.

### Background audio hardening

Beginning with Android 17, the audio framework enforces restrictions on
background audio interactions including audio playback, audio focus requests,
and volume change APIs to ensure that these changes are started intentionally by
the user.

If the app tries to call audio APIs while the app is not in a valid lifecycle,
the audio playback and volume change APIs fail silently without throwing an
exception or providing a failure message. The audio focus API fails with the
result code `AUDIOFOCUS_REQUEST_FAILED`.

For more information, including mitigation strategies, see [Background audio
hardening](/about/versions/17/changes/bg-audio).

## Connectivity

Android 17 includes the following changes to enhance device
connectivity.

### Autonomous re-pairing for Bluetooth bond losses

Android 17 introduces autonomous re-pairing, a system-level enhancement
designed to automatically resolve Bluetooth bond loss.

Previously, if a bond was lost, users had to manually navigate to Settings to
unpair and then re-pair the peripheral. This feature builds upon the security
improvement of Android 16 by allowing the system to re-establish bonds
in the background without requiring users to manually navigate to Settings to
unpair and re-pair peripherals.

While most apps will not require code changes, developers should be aware of the
following behavior changes in Bluetooth stack:

* **New pairing context:** The [`ACTION_PAIRING_REQUEST`](/reference/android/bluetooth/BluetoothDevice#ACTION_PAIRING_REQUEST) now includes the
  [`EXTRA_PAIRING_CONTEXT`](/reference/android/bluetooth/BluetoothDevice#EXTRA_PAIRING_CONTEXT) extra which allows apps to distinguish between a
  standard pairing request and an autonomous system-initiated re-pairing attempt.
* **Conditional key updates:** Existing security keys will only be replaced if
  the re-pairing is successful and new connection meets or exceeds the security
  level of the previous bond.
* **Modified intent timing:** The [`ACTION_KEY_MISSING`](/reference/android/bluetooth/BluetoothDevice#ACTION_KEY_MISSING) intent is now
  broadcast only if the autonomous re-pairing attempt fails. This reduces
  unnecessary error handling in the app if the system successfully recovers the
  bond in the background.
* **User notification:** The system manages re-pairing via new UI notifications
  and dialogs. Users will be prompted to confirm the re-pairing attempt to ensure
  they are aware of the reconnection.

Peripheral device manufacturers and companion app developers should verify that
hardware and app gracefully handle bond transitions. To test this behavior,
simulate a remote bond loss using either of the following methods:

* Manually remove the bond information from the peripheral device
* Manually unpair the device in: Settings > Connected devices
