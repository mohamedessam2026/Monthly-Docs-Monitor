# Migrate apps to Android 17 Stay organized with collections Save and categorize content based on your preferences.





This document provides an overview of development and testing actions you can
take to align with the Android platform release timeline and ensure a seamless
user experience on Android 17.

With each release of Android, we introduce new features as well as behavior
changes aimed at making Android more helpful, more secure, and more performant.
In many cases your app will work exactly as expected out-of-the-box, while in
other cases you might need to update your app to adapt to the platform changes.

Users can start receiving the new platform as soon as the source code is
released to AOSP (Android Open Source Project), so it's important for your apps
to be ready, performing as expected for users and ideally taking advantage of
new features and APIs to get the most out of the new platform.

A typical migration has two phases, which can be concurrent:

* Ensuring app compatibility (by Android 17 final release)
* Targeting the new platform features and APIs (as soon as possible after
  final release)

## Ensure compatibility with Android 17

It's important to test the functionality of your existing app against
Android 17 to ensure a great experience for users updating to the
latest version of Android. Some platform changes can affect the way your app
behaves, so it's important to test early and thoroughly and make any needed
adjustments to your app.

You can usually adjust your app and publish an update without needing to change
the app's `targetSdkVersion`. Similarly, you shouldn't need to use new APIs or
change the app's `compileSdkVersion`, although this can depend on the way your
app is built and the platform functionality it's using.

Before you start testing, be sure to familiarize yourself with the [behavior
changes for all apps](/about/versions/17/behavior-changes-all). These changes might affect your app, even if you don't
change its `targetSdkVersion`.

Get Android 17

Flash an Android 17 system image to your device, or download
a system image for the Android emulator.

Review changes

Review system behavior changes to identify areas where your app
might be affected.

Test

Install your app on your device or emulator, and run tests. Focus
on system behavior changes, and work through all app flows.

Update

Make only the code changes required to adapt to behavior
changes or resolve issues. Recompile with the same API level
that your app originally targeted - no need to target Android 17.

Publish

Sign, upload, and publish your updated Android App Bundle
or APK.

### Test your app for compatibility on Android 17

For the most part, testing compatibility with Android 17 is
similar to ordinary app testing. This is a good time to review the [core app
quality guidelines](/docs/quality-guidelines/core-app-quality) and [best practices for testing](/training/testing).

To test, install your current published app on a device running
Android 17, and work through the flows and functionality
to identify issues. To focus your tests,
**review the [behavior changes for all apps](/about/versions/17/behavior-changes-all)** introduced in
Android 17 that can affect how your app functions or cause your
app to crash.

Also make sure to **review and test for uses of [restricted non-SDK
interfaces](/about/versions/17/changes/non-sdk-17)**. You should replace any restricted interface your app uses with
a public SDK or NDK equivalent. Watch for logcat warnings that highlight these
accesses, and use the `StrictMode` method [`detectNonSdkApiUsage()`](/reference/android/os/StrictMode.VmPolicy.Builder#detectNonSdkApiUsage()) to catch
them programmatically.

Last, make sure to fully **test the libraries and SDKs in your app** to make
sure they work as expected on Android 17 and follow best
practices for privacy, performance, UX, data handling, and permissions. If you
find an issue, try updating to the latest version of the SDK, or reach out to
the SDK developer for help.

When you've finished testing and made updates, we recommend publishing
your compatible app right away. This lets your users test the app early and
helps ensure a smooth transition for your users as they update to
Android 17.

## Update the app's targeting and build with new APIs

Once you've published a compatible version of your app, the next step is to add
full support for Android 17 by updating its `targetSdkVersion`
and taking advantage of new APIs and capabilities in Android 17.
You can make these updates as soon as you're ready, keeping in mind the [Google
Play requirements](/distribute/play-policies) for targeting the new platform.

As you plan your work to fully support Android 17, review the
[behavior changes that affect apps targeting Android 17](/about/versions/17/behavior-changes-17).
These *targeted behavior changes* might cause functional issues you then need to
address. In some cases, these changes require significant development, so we
recommend learning about and addressing them as early as possible. To help
identify specific behavior changes that affect your app, use the [compatibility
toggles](/about/versions/17/migration#using_app_compatibility_toggles) to test your app with selected changes enabled.

The following steps describe how to fully support Android 17.

Get Android 17 SDK

Install the latest version of Android Studio preview to build
with Android 17. Make sure you have an Android 17 device or
emulator.  
Update your `targetSdkVersion` and other build
configurations.

Review behavior changes

Review the behavior changes that apply to apps targeting
Android 17. Identify areas where your app might be affected,
and plan how to support them.

Check against new privacy changes

Make code and architecture changes needed to support Android 17's
user privacy changes.

Adopt Android 17 features

Take advantage of Android 17 APIs to bring new features and
capabilities to your apps. Recompile for Android 17.

Test

Test on an Android 17 device or emulator. Focus on areas
where behavior changes might affect your app. Try out
functionality that uses new APIs. Provide platform and API
feedback. Report any platform, API, or third-party SDK issues.

Final update

Once Android 17 APIs are final, update your
`targetSdkVersion` and other build configurations
again, make any additional updates, and test your app.

Publish

Sign, upload, and publish your updated Android App Bundle
or APK.

### Get the SDK, change targeting, build with new APIs

To start testing for full Android 17 support, use the latest
preview version of Android Studio to download the Android 17 SDK
and any other tools you need. Next, update your app's `targetSdkVersion` and
`compileSdkVersion`, and re-compile the app. See the [SDK setup guide](/about/versions/17/setup-sdk) for
details.

### Test your Android 17 app

Once you've compiled the app and installed it on a device running
Android 17, begin testing to ensure that the app works properly
when targeting Android 17. Some behavior changes apply only when
your app is targeting the new platform, so you'll want to [review those
changes](/about/versions/17/behavior-changes-17) before getting started.

As with basic compatibility testing, work through all the flows and
functionality looking for issues. Focus your testing on the
**[behavior changes for apps targeting Android 17](/about/versions/17/behavior-changes-17)**. It's
also a good time to check your app against the [core app quality guidelines](/docs/quality-guidelines/core-app-quality)
and [best practices for testing](/training/testing).

Make sure to review and **test for uses of [restricted non-SDK interfaces](/about/versions/17/changes/non-sdk-17)**
that may apply. Watch for logcat warnings that highlight these accesses and use
the StrictMode method [`detectNonSdkApiUsage()`](/reference/android/os/StrictMode.VmPolicy.Builder#detectNonSdkApiUsage()) to catch them
programmatically.

Last, make sure to fully **test the libraries and SDKs in your app** to make
sure they work as expected on Android 17 and follow best
practices for privacy, performance, UX, data handling, and permissions. If you
find an issue, try updating to the latest version of the SDK, or reach out to
the SDK developer for help.

### Test using app compatibility toggles

Android 17 includes compatibility toggles that make it easier to test your app
with targeted behavior changes. For a debuggable app, the toggles let you:

* **Test targeted changes without actually changing the app's
  targetSdkVersion**. You can use the toggles to force-enable specific
  targeted behavior changes to evaluate the impact on your existing app.
* **Focus your testing on specific changes only**. Rather than having to
  address all targeted changes at once, the toggles let you disable all
  targeted changes except the ones you want to test against.
* **Manage toggles through adb**. You can use adb commands to enable and
  disable the toggleable changes in your automated test environment.
* **Debug faster using standard change IDs**. Toggleable changes each have a
  unique ID and name that you can use to quickly debug root cause in log
  output.

As you prepare to change your app's targeting, or while you're in active
development for Android 17 support, the toggles can help. For more information,
see [Compatibility framework changes (Android 17)](/about/versions/17/reference/compat-framework-changes).
