# Updates to non-SDK interface restrictions in Android 16 Stay organized with collections Save and categorize content based on your preferences.





Android 16 includes updated lists of restricted non-SDK interfaces based
on collaboration with Android developers and the latest internal testing.
Whenever possible, we make sure that public alternatives are available before we
restrict non-SDK interfaces.

If your app does not target Android 16 (API level 36), some of these
changes might not immediately affect you. However, while it's possible for your
app to access some non-SDK interfaces [depending on your app's target API
level](/guide/app-compatibility/restrictions-non-sdk-interfaces#list-names)), using any non-SDK method or field always carries a high
risk of breaking your app.

If you are unsure if your app uses non-SDK interfaces, you can
[test your app](/guide/app-compatibility/restrictions-non-sdk-interfaces#test-for-non-sdk) to find out. If your app relies on non-SDK
interfaces, you should begin planning a migration to SDK alternatives.
Nevertheless, we understand that some apps have valid use cases for using
non-SDK interfaces. If you can't find an alternative to using a non-SDK
interface for a feature in your app, you should
[request a new public API](/guide/app-compatibility/restrictions-non-sdk-interfaces#feature-request).
