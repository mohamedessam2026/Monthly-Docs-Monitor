**Warning:** Hey Googler! Before sideloading a new release, please check your
Building on the [initial release of Android 16](/about/versions/16), we continue to
update the platform with fixes and improvements that are then rolled out to
supported devices. These releases happen on a quarterly cadence through
*Quarterly Platform Releases* (QPRs), which are delivered both to AOSP and to
Google Pixel devices as part of *Feature Drops*.

Although these updates don't include app-impacting API changes, we provide
images of the latest QPR beta builds so you can test your app with these builds
as needed (for example, if there are upcoming features that might impact the
user experience of your app).

* Pixel 6 and 6 Pro
* Pixel 6a
* Pixel 7 and 7 Pro
* Pixel 7a
* Pixel Fold
* Pixel Tablet
* Pixel 8 and 8 Pro
* Pixel 8a
* Pixel 9, 9 Pro, 9 Pro XL, and 9 Pro Fold
* Pixel 9a
* Pixel 10, 10 Pro, 10 Pro XL, and 10 Pro Fold

To find OTA images for already-released, stable versions of the platform, see
[Full OTA Images for Nexus and Pixel Devices](https://developers.google.com/android/ota).
Applying an OTA image can help you recover a device that received an OTA update
for an Android 16 QPR Beta build but wouldn't start up after the update was
installed. If you are trying to get Android 16 QPR3 on your device but you
aren't trying to recover from a failed OTA update, see [Get Android 16 QPR beta
builds](/about/versions/16/qpr3/get) instead.
OTA images are available for the following Pixel devices:
\* Pixel 6 and 6 Pro
\* Pixel 7, 7a, and 7 Pro
\* Pixel Fold
\* Pixel Tablet
\* Pixel 8, 8a, and 8 Pro
\* Pixel 9, 9a, 9 Pro, 9 Pro XL, and 9 Pro Fold

After you've installed a beta build to your Pixel device, your device is
automatically enrolled in the [Android Beta for Pixel program](https://g.co/androidbeta) and offered
continuous over-the-air (OTA) updates to the latest beta builds (including QPRs)
until you choose to unenroll that device from the program. We also deliver
flashable images at each milestone, so you can choose the approach that works
best for your test environment.
Use the following links and instructions to update your supported device to the
latest build. See [Get Android 16 QPR beta builds](/about/versions/16/qpr3/get) for other ways to get QPR3
for testing and development.

## Apply an OTA image

![](/static/images/lockups/android-stacked.svg)
Download an OTA device image from the following table and apply it by following
the [updating instructions](https://developers.google.com/android/ota#instructions) listed on [Full OTA Images for Nexus and Pixel
Devices](https://developers.google.com/android/ota).
You can choose to [return to the latest public build](#public) at any time.Warning: Before applying an Android 16 OTA image, we strongly recommend that you
[unlock the bootloader](https://source.android.com/docs/core/architecture/bootloader/locking_unlocking) on your device if possible. Unlocking the bootloader
requires a full device reset that removes all user data on the device, so make
sure to back up your data first.

## Return to a public build

You can either use the Android Flash Tool to
[flash the factory image](https://flash.android.com/back-to-public), or obtain a factory spec system
image from the [Factory Images for Nexus and Pixel Devices](https://developers.google.com/android/images)
page and then manually flash it to the device.

**Warning:** Going back to a public build from a preview build (Developer Preview
or Beta) requires a full device reset that removes all user data on the device.
Make sure to [back up your data first](https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/7179901).
