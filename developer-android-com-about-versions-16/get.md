You can get Android 16 in any of the following ways:

* [Get Android 16 on a Google Pixel device](#on_pixel)
* [Get Android 16 Beta on a partner device](#on_partner)
* [Set up the Android Emulator](#on_emulator)
* [Get a generic system image (GSI)](#on_gsi)

## Get Android 16 on a Google Pixel device

If you have a [supported Pixel device](#google-pixel-devices), you can [check and update your
Android version](https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/7680439) to receive Android 16 over the air.

In most cases, you don't need to do a full reset of your data to move to Android
16, but it's recommended that you back up data before installing Android 16 on
your device.

### Supported Google Pixel devices

Android 16 OTAs and downloads are available for the following Pixel devices:

* Pixel 6 and 6 Pro
* Pixel 6a
* Pixel 7 and 7 Pro
* Pixel 7a
* Pixel Fold
* Pixel Tablet
* Pixel 8 and 8 Pro
* Pixel 8a
* Pixel 9, 9 Pro, 9 Pro XL, and 9 Pro Fold
* Pixel 9a

### Flash or manually install a system image

Alternatively, if you'd rather flash your device, we recommend using the
[Android Flash Tool](https://flash.android.com/release/16.0.0).

If you need to flash your device manually for some other reason, you can get the
Android 16 system image for your device on the [Pixel downloads page](https://developers.google.com/android/images). Read
the general instructions for how to [flash a system image](https://developers.google.com/android/images#instructions) to your device.
This approach can be useful when you need more control over testing, such as for
automated testing or regression testing.

## Get Android 16 Beta on a partner device

The following device-maker partners are offering Android 16 Beta for you to try
on some of their top devices:

* HONOR
* iQOO
* Lenovo
* OnePlus
* OPPO
* realme
* vivo
* Xiaomi

You can learn how to install Android 16 Beta by visiting each partner's site.
Each partner provides a system image that you can download and flash. Some
partners might also support over-the-air (OTA) delivery. Each partner provides
support resources to guide you through the installation process—use the
**Get the Beta** link on the [Android 16 Beta devices](/about/versions/16/devices) page to jump to the
partner's download and OTA information.

Each Android 16 Beta partner provides its own channel for reporting issues found
on their supported Beta devices. We highly recommend using each partner's
feedback channel to report bugs and feedback that are specific to their devices.

## Set up the Android Emulator

Configuring the Android Emulator to run Android 16 is a flexible solution for
exploring new features and APIs and testing Android 16 behavior changes. It
lets you emulate various screen sizes and device characteristics.

Depending on the type of testing you need to do, consider setting up a variety
of virtual devices from these device categories:

* [Phone](#phone-avd)
* [Tablet or large-screen device](#large-screen-avd)

### Set up a virtual device (phone)

To set up a virtual device to emulate a typical phone, follow these steps:

1. Install [Android Studio Meerkat | 2024.3.1](/studio).
2. In Android Studio, click **Tools > SDK Manager**.
3. In the **SDK Tools tab**, select the latest version of **Android Emulator**,
   and then click the **OK** button. This action installs the latest version
   if it isn't already installed.
4. In Android Studio, click **Tools > Device Manager**. In the
   **Device Manager** panel, click the
   **Add a new device** button ![Add new device
   icon](/static/studio/images/buttons/ic_plus_dark.png),
   then select **Create Virtual Device**.

   ![Create an Android Virtual Device in Android
   Studio](/static/about/versions/16/images/16-create-avd.png)
5. From the **Phone Category tab**, select a device definition for a
   [supported Pixel device](#on_pixel), then click the **Next** button.
6. Find the Android 16 system image, named **Baklava**, and click the
   **Download** button ![Download
   icon](/static/about/versions/16/images/16-studio-download.png)
   next to the **Release Name**. After the download completes, select
   this system image, and then click the **Next** button.
7. Finalize other settings for your virtual device, and then click the
   **Finish** button.
8. After returning to the list of virtual devices in the **Device Manager**,
   find your Android 16 virtual device, and then click the **Start** button
   ![Start button icon](/static/about/versions/16/images/16-launch-avd-icon.png).

### Set up a virtual device (tablet or large-screen)

To set up a virtual device to emulate a tablet or other large-screen device,
follow these steps:

1. Install [Android Studio Meerkat | 2024.3.1](/studio).
2. In Android Studio, click **Tools > SDK Manager**.
3. In the **SDK Tools tab**, select the latest version of **Android Emulator**,
   and then click the **OK** button. This action installs the latest version
   if it isn't already installed.
4. In Android Studio, click **Tools > Device Manager**. In the **Device
   Manager** panel, click the **Add a new device** button ![Add new device
   icon](/static/studio/images/buttons/ic_plus_dark.png),
   then select **Create Virtual Device**.

   ![Create an Android Virtual Device in Android
   Studio](/static/about/versions/16/images/16-create-avd.png)
5. From the **Tablet Category tab**, select a device definition with a large
   screen, such as the **Pixel Tablet**, or from the **Phone Category tab**,
   select the **Pixel Fold**. Then, click the **Next** button.
6. Find the Android 16 system image, named **Baklava**, and click the
   **Download** button ![Download
   icon](/static/about/versions/16/images/16-studio-download.png)
   next to the **Release Name**. After the download completes, select
   this system image, and then click the **Next** button.
7. Finalize other settings for your virtual device, and then click the
   **Finish** button.
8. After returning to the list of virtual devices in the **Device Manager**,
   find your Android 16 virtual device, and then click the **Start** button
   ![Start button
   icon](/static/about/versions/16/images/16-launch-avd-icon.png).

Repeat these steps to create large screen device definitions that you can use to
test your app in a variety of large screen scenarios.

#### Resizable emulator

In addition to large screen virtual devices that you can configure for Android
16, you can try the resizable device configuration. When you're using a
resizable device definition with an Android 16 system image, the Android
Emulator lets you toggle between the three reference devices: phone,
foldable, and tablet. When using the foldable reference device, you can also
toggle between folded and unfolded states.

This flexibility makes it easier to both validate your layout at design time and
test the behavior at runtime, using the same reference devices. To create a new
resizable emulator, use the Device Manager in Android Studio to create a new
virtual device and select the **Resizable** device definition in the **Phone**
category.

](/about/versions/16/images/16-resizable-emulator.png)](/static/about/versions/16/images/16-resizable-emulator.mp4)


Use the resizable device definition for the Android Emulator
to test Android 16 in a variety of large screen scenarios.

## Get a generic system image (GSI)

Android [Generic System Image (GSI)](/topic/generic-system-image) binaries are available to developers
for app testing and validation purposes on supported Treble-compliant devices.
You can use these images to address any compatibility issues as well as discover
and report OS and framework issues.

See the [GSI documentation](/topic/generic-system-image) for device requirements, flashing instructions,
and information on choosing the right image type for your device. Once you're
ready to download a GSI binary, see the [Downloads section](/topic/generic-system-image/releases#android-gsi-16) on the GSI
binaries page.
