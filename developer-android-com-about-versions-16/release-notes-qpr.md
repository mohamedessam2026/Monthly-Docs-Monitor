  [Issue #435011484](https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/435011484))
* The Context Hub, a low-power sensor component, would crash due to
  excessive use of main memory, causing device instability; resolved by
  optimizing memory allocation and preventing memory leaks. (
  [Issue #420999948](https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/420999948),
  [Issue #426316038](https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/426316038))
* The home screen sometimes lost its bottom row of pinned apps and the search bar, making them inaccessible; this was fixed by adjusting how these elements reappear after screen transitions. ([Issue #428088033](https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/428088033), [Issue #428405658](https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/428405658), [Issue #429817851](https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/429817851))

([Issue #421792538](https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/421792538), [Issue #422749237](https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/422749237), [Issue #420418750](https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/420418750), [Issue #428896474](https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/428896474))
* An issue that caused unexpected device restarts. ([Issue #427676713](https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/427676713))
* The Quick Settings UI on unfolded foldable devices appeared clipped or misaligned due to incorrect padding caused by double-counting the camera cutout. ([Issue #419184923](https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/419184923), [Issue #421879049](https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/421879049), [Issue #421810067](https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/421810067), [Issue #423172198](https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/423172198), [Issue #422560004](https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/422560004), [Issue #424116279](https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/424116279))

* The status bar appearing in the Quick Settings shade was sometimes misaligned with the standard status bar, causing a visual inconsistency. ([Issue #419573315](https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/419573315), [Issue #419134909](https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/419134909), [Issue #432794874](https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/432794874))
* Addressed a system hang or crash, particularly during unlock, caused by the camera's Ambient Light Sensor (ALS) read getting stuck, by implementing a non-blocking method for sensor data retrieval. ([Issue #421870862](https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/421870862), [Issue #420725698](https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/420725698))
* The media player on the lock screen would sometimes disappear or become unresponsive. ([Issue #420517884](https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/420517884))
* An issue where the notification shade displayed a large, growing gap, obscuring notifications, by correcting how notification animations were clipped. ([Issue #421366916](https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/421366916))
* An issue where the media player notification could appear clipped or disappear during device rotation, by improving how its display area is sized and updated in UI transitions. ([Issue #433040374](https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/433040374))
* Video calls initiated from voice calls no longer experience muted audio; a system audio fix now correctly manages sound output during call type transitions. ([Issue #434139133](https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/434139133), [Issue #427060263](https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/427060263), [Issue #438414975](https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/438414975))
* An issue where black translucent bars appeared at the top and bottom of the home screen after exiting full-screen apps by correcting how transient system bar states were cleared. ([Issue #425407737](https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/425407737), [Issue #433929827](https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/433929827))
* An issue that caused the device to unexpectedly crash and restart during an OTA update.
* An issue causing occasional device restarts after system updates.
* Widgets on the home screen sometimes failed to load due to looking for outdated app files.
* Typing occasionally stopped working in apps because internal input system processes could race.
* Device crashes caused by the Context Hub running out of memory.
* Bluetooth crashes and instability caused by an "Unimplemented Packet Type" error have been resolved.
* An issue that could cause phone disconnections or system crashes during calls by resolving a memory corruption bug in audio data buffer handling related to audio playback speed changes.
* A brief screen flicker happened when launching apps from the notification shade.
* A system crash that could occur when using your device's media features, especially when connected to a computer for media transfer, by improving the internal handling of media connection resources.

## About Android 16 QPR1 Beta 3 (July 2025)

Building on the [initial release of Android 16](/about/versions/16), we continue to
update the platform with fixes and improvements that are then rolled out to
supported devices. These releases happen on a quarterly cadence through
*Quarterly Platform Releases* (QPRs), which are delivered both to AOSP and to
Google Pixel devices as part of *Feature Drops*.

Although these updates don't include app-impacting API changes, we provide
images of the latest QPR beta builds so you can test your app with these builds
as needed (for example, if there are upcoming features that might impact the
user experience of your app).

Unlike developer previews and betas for unreleased, major versions of Android,
these builds are suitable for general use.

### How to get QPR1 Beta 3

You can install Android 16 QPR1 Beta 3 on any of the following Google Pixel
devices:

* Pixel 6 and 6 Pro
* Pixel 6a
* Pixel 7 and 7 Pro
* Pixel 7a
* Pixel Fold
* Pixel Tablet
* Pixel 8 and 8 Pro

### General advisories

Be aware of these general advisories about the release:

* For users with accessibility needs, this release might not be appropriate
  for daily use.

  limitation includes Google's apps as well as other apps.
* Android 16 QPR beta builds aren't [Compatibility Test Suite
  (CTS)](https://source.android.com/compatibility/cts/)-approved, but they have passed preliminary testing and provide a
  stable set of pre-release APIs for developers. Apps that depend on
  CTS-approved builds or use SafetyNet APIs might not work normally on Android
  16 QPR beta builds.

### Get support

Two primary support channels are available to you when developing and testing
with Android 16 QPR1. The channel you should use to get support depends on where
you are encountering your issue.
