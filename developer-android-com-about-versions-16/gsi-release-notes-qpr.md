# Android 16 GSI binaries and release notes Stay organized with collections Save and categorize content based on your preferences.





Android [Generic System Image (GSI)](/topic/generic-system-image) binaries are available to developers for
app testing and validation purposes on [supported Treble-compliant devices](/topic/generic-system-image#device-compliance).
Developers
can use these images to address any compatibility issues with
Android 16 QPR2 as well as discover and report OS and framework issues
until Android 16 QPR2 is officially released.

GSI binaries for Android 16 are built from the same AOSP and
GMS sources as the [corresponding Google Pixel builds](/about/versions/16/download). These binaries
contain the same API and SDK, have a similar CTS result, and have been validated
on the following Pixel devices:

* Pixel 6 and 6 Pro
* Pixel 6a
* Pixel 7 and 7 Pro
* Pixel 7a
* Pixel Fold
* Pixel Tablet
* Pixel 8 and 8 Pro
* Pixel 8a
* Pixel 9, 9 Pro, 9 Pro XL, and 9 Pro Fold
* Pixel 9a

See the [GSI documentation](/topic/generic-system-image) for device requirements, flashing instructions,
and more information on choosing the right image type for your device.

**Note:** [**File GSI bugs**](https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/new?component=1109161&template=1620756) for any system-related issues you encounter. Make
sure to attach a full bug report and **clearly indicate that you are using a GSI
build** in your bug description to help the Android team find your issues and
address them more quickly. For app-related issues found when using a GSI, we
recommend reproducing the issue on a Pixel device before contacting the app
developer directly.

## General advisories

GSI binaries offer core OS and framework capabilities that are common to all
Android 16
beta builds, but they might be missing specific capabilities as listed and are
not intended for general use.

Before you start using a GSI, review the following general advisories:

* GSI binaries are an experimental tool intended only for use by developers
  who want early access to test and validate their apps.
* Using a GSI might void the warranty for your device, erase all data on your
  device, and might make parts of your device unusable.
* Using a GSI requires a bootloader-unlocked, Treble-compliant device that
  originally launched with Android 9 (API level 28) or higher.
* Apps embedded in GSIs are for evaluation usage; some apps might not function
  as expected.
* GSI releases aren't [Compatibility Test Suite (CTS)](https://source.android.com/compatibility/cts/)-approved. Apps that
  depend on CTS-approved builds might not work normally.

## Install with Android Flash Tool

**Android Flash Tool** lets you securely flash a system image
to your supported Pixel device. Android Flash Tool works with any Web browser
that supports WebUSB, such as Chrome or Edge 79+.

Android Flash Tool guides you step-by-step through the process of flashing your
device—there's no need to have tools installed—but you do need to unlock your
device and [enable USB Debugging in Developer options](/studio/debug/dev-options#enable). For
complete instructions, see the [Android Flash Tool
documentation](https://source.android.com/setup/contribute/flash).

Connect your device over USB, then, depending on the type of system image you
want to flash, navigate to Android Flash Tool using one of the following links
and follow the onscreen guidance:

* **ARM64 GSI with GMS**: <https://flash.android.com/preview/baklava-qpr3-beta2.1-gsi-gms>
* **ARM64 GSI**: <https://flash.android.com/preview/baklava-qpr3-beta2.1-gsi>

## Known issues

Android 16 GSI binaries have the following GSI-specific known issues that might
occur with some devices and builds:

* **Power Cycle**: Rebooting GSI might fail on some devices. To work around
  it, reboot the device into recovery mode, erase user data, perform a factory
  reset, and then reboot the device.
* **System partition size**: GSI + GMS file size (images named
  `_gsi\_gms\_arm64-*_`) might be bigger than the default dynamic system
  partition size on your device. To work around this issue, you can delete
  some non-essential dynamic partitions, such as the product partition, and
  flash the GSI again. For more information, see the [flashing GSIs
  documentation](https://source.android.com/setup/build/gsi#flashing-gsis).

### 9. Changes to the License Agreement

### 10. General Legal Terms

10.1 The License Agreement constitutes the whole legal agreement between you and Google and governs your use of GMS+GSI (excluding any services which Google may provide to you under a separate written agreement), and completely replaces any prior agreements between you and Google in relation to GMS+GSI.  
  
10.2 You agree that if Google does not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy which is contained in the License Agreement (or which Google has the benefit of under any applicable law), this will not be taken to be a formal waiver of Google's rights and that those rights or remedies will still be available to Google.  
  
10.3 If any court of law, having the jurisdiction to decide on this matter, rules that any provision of the License Agreement is invalid, then that provision will be removed from the License Agreement without affecting the rest of the License Agreement. The remaining provisions of the License Agreement will continue to be valid and enforceable.  
  
10.4 You acknowledge and agree that each member of the group of companies of which Google is the parent shall be third party beneficiaries to the License Agreement and that such other companies shall be entitled to directly enforce, and rely upon, any provision of the License Agreement that confers a benefit on (or rights in favor of) them. Other than this, no other person or company shall be third party beneficiaries to the License Agreement.  
  
10.5 EXPORT RESTRICTIONS. GMS+GSI IS SUBJECT TO UNITED STATES EXPORT LAWS AND REGULATIONS. YOU MUST COMPLY WITH ALL DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL EXPORT LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT APPLY TO GMS+GSI. THESE LAWS INCLUDE RESTRICTIONS ON DESTINATIONS, END USERS AND END USE.  
  
10.6 The rights granted in the License Agreement may not be assigned or transferred by either you or Google without the prior written approval of the other party. Neither you nor Google shall be permitted to delegate their responsibilities or obligations under the License Agreement without the prior written approval of the other party.  
  
10.7 The License Agreement, and your relationship with Google under the License Agreement, shall be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of laws provisions. You and Google agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located within the county of Santa Clara, California to resolve any legal matter arising from the License Agreement. Notwithstanding this, you agree that Google shall still be allowed to apply for injunctive remedies (or an equivalent type of urgent legal relief) in any jurisdiction.
