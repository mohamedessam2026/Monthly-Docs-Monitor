| Category | Type | Name |
| --- | --- | --- |
|
 Core functionality | Change (all apps) | [ART internal changes](/about/versions/16/behavior-changes-all#art-changes)  Android 16 includes the latest updates to the Android Runtime (ART) that improve the Android Runtime's (ART's) performance and provide support for additional Java features. Through Google Play System updates, these improvements are also available to over a billion devices running Android 12 (API level 31) and higher. As these changes are released, libraries and app code that rely on internal structures of ART might not work correctly on devices running Android 16, along with earlier Android versions that update the ART module through Google Play system updates. |
|
 Core functionality | Change (all apps) | [JobScheduler quota optimizations](/about/versions/16/behavior-changes-all#job-quota-opt)  Android 16 adjusts the regular and expedited job execution runtime quota based on a few factors: which app standby bucket the application is in, whether the job starts execution while the app is in a top state, and whether the job is executing while running a Foreground Service. |
|
 Core functionality | Change (all apps) | [Abandoned empty jobs stop reason](/about/versions/16/behavior-changes-all#abandoned-job-stop-reason)  To detect and reduce abandoned jobs, apps should use the new `STOP_REASON_TIMEOUT_ABANDONED` job stop reason that the system assigns for abandoned jobs, instead of `STOP_REASON_TIMEOUT`. |
|
 Core functionality | Change (all apps) | [Ordered broadcast priority scope no longer global](/about/versions/16/behavior-changes-all#ordered-broadcast-priority)  In Android 16, broadcast delivery order using the [`android:priority`](/guide/topics/manifest/intent-filter-element) attribute or [`IntentFilter#setPriority()`](/reference/android/content/IntentFilter#setPriority(int)) across different processes will not be guaranteed. Broadcast priorities for ordered broadcasts will only be respected within the same application process rather than across all system processes. |
|
 Core functionality | Change (all apps) | [16 KB page size compatibility mode](/about/versions/16/behavior-changes-all#16-kb-compatibility-mode)  Android 15 introduced support for 16 KB memory pages to optimize performance of the platform. Android 16 adds a compatibility mode, allowing some apps built for 4 KB memory pages to run on a device configured for 16 KB memory pages. |
|
 Core functionality | Change (apps targeting 16+) | [Fixed rate work scheduling optimization](/about/versions/16/behavior-changes-16#schedule-at-fixed-rate)  For apps targeting targeting Android 16 or higher, at most one missed execution of [`scheduleAtFixedRate`](/reference/java/util/concurrent/ScheduledExecutorService#scheduleAtFixedRate(java.lang.Runnable,%20long,%20long,%20java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit)) will be immediately executed when the app returns to a valid lifecycle. |
|
 Core functionality | New features and APIs | [Two Android API releases in 2025](/about/versions/16/features#two-android)  In Android 16, the preview is for the next major release of Android with a planned launch in Q2 of 2025. This release is similar to all of our API releases in the past, where we can have planned behavior changes that are often tied to a targetSdkVersion. We plan to have another release in Q4 of 2025 which also will include new developer APIs. The Q2 major release will be the only release in 2025 to include planned behavior changes that could affect apps. |
