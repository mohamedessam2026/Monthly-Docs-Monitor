# Changes to foreground service types for Android 15 Stay organized with collections Save and categorize content based on your preferences.





We are making the following changes to foreground service types with Android
15.

### Media processing

Foreground service type to declare in manifest under

`android:foregroundServiceType`
:   `mediaProcessing`

Permission to declare in your manifest
:   `FOREGROUND_SERVICE_MEDIA_PROCESSING`

Constant to pass to `startForeground()`
:   `FOREGROUND_SERVICE_TYPE_MEDIA_PROCESSING`

Runtime prerequisites
:   None

Description
:   Service for performing time-consuming operations on media assets, like
    converting media to different formats. The system allows this service a limited
    time to run; under normal circumstances, this time limit would be 6 hours out of
    every 24. (This limit is shared by all of an app's `mediaProcessing` foreground
    services.)
:   Your app should manually stop the media processing service in the following
    scenario:

    * When the transcoding operation finishes or reaches a failure state, have the
      service call [`Service.stopForeground()`](/reference/android/app/Service#stopForeground(int)) and [`Service.stopSelf()`](/reference/android/app/Service#stopSelf())
      to stop the service completely.
:   If the timeout period is reached, the system calls the service's
    [`Service.onTimeout(int, int)`](/reference/android/app/Service#onTimeout(int,%20int)) method. At this
    time, the service has a few
    seconds to call [`Service.stopSelf()`](/reference/android/app/Service#stopSelf()). If the service does not call
    `Service.stopSelf()`, an ANR will occur with this error message: "A
    foreground service of *<fgs\_type>* did not stop within its
    timeout: *<component\_name>*".

    **Note**: `Service.onTimeout(int, int)` is not available on Android 14
    or lower. On devices running those versions, if a media processing
    service reaches the timeout period, the system immediately caches the app.
    For this reason, your app shouldn't wait to get a timeout notification.
    Instead, it should terminate the foreground service or change it to a
    background service as soon as appropriate.

### Camera

Apps that target Android 15 or higher are not allowed to launch a
camera foreground service from a `BOOT_COMPLETED` broadcast receiver.
For more information, see
[Restrictions on `BOOT_COMPLETED` broadcast receivers launching foreground
services](/about/versions/15/behavior-changes-15#fgs-boot-completed).

### Data sync

Apps that target Android 15 or higher are not allowed to launch a
data sync foreground service from a `BOOT_COMPLETED` broadcast receiver.
For more information, see
[Restrictions on `BOOT_COMPLETED` broadcast receivers launching foreground
services](/about/versions/15/behavior-changes-15#fgs-boot-completed).

### Media playback

Apps that target Android 15 or higher are not allowed to launch a
media playback foreground service from a `BOOT_COMPLETED` broadcast receiver.
For more information, see
[Restrictions on `BOOT_COMPLETED` broadcast receivers launching foreground
services](/about/versions/15/behavior-changes-15#fgs-boot-completed).

### Media projection

Apps that target Android 15 or higher are not allowed to launch a
media projection foreground service from a `BOOT_COMPLETED` broadcast receiver.
For more information, see
[Restrictions on `BOOT_COMPLETED` broadcast receivers launching foreground
services](/about/versions/15/behavior-changes-15#fgs-boot-completed).

### Microphone

Apps that target Android 14 (API level 34) or higher are not allowed to launch a
microphone foreground service from a `BOOT_COMPLETED` broadcast receiver.
For more information, see
[Restrictions on `BOOT_COMPLETED` broadcast receivers launching foreground
services](/about/versions/15/behavior-changes-15#fgs-boot-completed).

### Phone call

Apps that target Android 15 or higher are not allowed to launch a
phone call foreground service from a `BOOT_COMPLETED` broadcast receiver.
For more information, see
[Restrictions on `BOOT_COMPLETED` broadcast receivers launching foreground
services](/about/versions/15/behavior-changes-15#fgs-boot-completed).
